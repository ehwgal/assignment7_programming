*by Ellemijn Galjaard*

This project uses a Portuguese [open-source TTS dataset](https://github.com/Edresson/TTS-Portuguese-Corpus) (please refer to the following [LICENSE](https://github.com/Edresson/TTS-Portuguese-Corpus/blob/master/LICENSE)) to train a [COQUI-based](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) TTS model (please refer to the following [LICENSE](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/blob/dev/LICENSE.txt)). This project is a school project and not intended for commercial use.

**Please note that no ``requirements.txt`` file is added as this file is pulled and executed within ``run_model.ipynb``.**
