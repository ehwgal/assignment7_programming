ASSIGNMENT 7 PROGRAMMING
----------------------------
*by Ellemijn Galjaard*

**Sidenote**: *Unfortunately, this project is only partly finished (the model runs for a single epoch but is not tested in any manner). This is because it already took several days to get the data and model to work as it should. I might add additional commits to evaluate the model in the future, but they won't count towards this assignment.*

This project uses a Portuguese [open-source TTS dataset](https://github.com/Edresson/TTS-Portuguese-Corpus) (please refer to the following [LICENSE](https://github.com/Edresson/TTS-Portuguese-Corpus/blob/master/LICENSE)) to train a [COQUI-based](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) TTS model (please refer to the following [LICENSE](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/blob/dev/LICENSE.txt)). This project is a school project and not intended for commercial use.

**Please note that no ``requirements.txt`` file is added as this file is pulled and executed within ``run_model.ipynb``.**

STEPS TO RUN THIS PROJECT
-----------------------------

1. Download this project as a .zip file or use **``git clone git@github.com:ehwgal/assignment7_programming.git``** to clone it to your local environment or Google Colab.

2. Move into the root directory (**``cd assignment7_programming``**).
